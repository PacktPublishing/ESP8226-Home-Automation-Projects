# ESP8226 Home Automation Projects
This is the code repository for [ESP8226 Home Automation Projects](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/esp8266-home-automation-projects?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=9781787282629), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the book
The ESP8266 is a low-cost yet powerful Wi-Fi chip that is becoming more popular at an alarming rate, and people have adopted it to create interesting projects.

With this book, you will learn to create and program home automation projects using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip. You will learn how to build a thermostat to measure and adjust the temperature accordingly and how to build a security system using the ESP8266. Furthermore, you will design a complete home automation system from sensor to your own cloud. You will touch base on data monitoring, controlling appliances, and security aspects.

By the end of the book, you will understand how to completely control and monitor your home from the cloud and from a mobile application. You will be familiar with the capabilities of the ESP8266 and will have successfully designed a complete ready-to-sell home automated system.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter 01.

The code will look like the following:
   
   
        #include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
        #include <JsonListener.h>
        #include "WundergroundClient.h"
        
## What you need for this book
In order to start working with ESP8266, you will need a series of software and hardware components.
The ESP8266 chip and its module, sensors like ADXL345, temperature sensors, PIR sensors and cables, soldering tools. In every chapter, I've tried to make a good picture and provide the good description.
For the software, we would require PC with Windows and VirtualBox installed. For application Arduino IDE with at least 1.5.3 SDK version for the ESP8266, Lubuntu Linux 16.04 installed in Virtual Box, Docker installed in Virtual Box, InfluxDB and Grafana installed in Virtual Box.
